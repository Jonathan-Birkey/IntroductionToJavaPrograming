 * Exercise 5.8
 * (Find the highest score) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the number
 * of students and each studentâ€™s name and score, and finally displays the name of
 * the student with the highest score. Use the next() method in the Scanner class to
 * read a name, rather than using the nextLine() method. Assume that the number of
 * students is at least 1.
