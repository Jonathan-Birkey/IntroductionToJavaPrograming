 * Exercise 5.9
 * (Find the two highest scores) Write a program that prompts the user to enter the
 * number of students and each studentâ€™s name and score, and finally displays the
 * student with the highest score and the student with the second-highest score. Use
 * the next() method in the Scanner class to read a name rather than using the
 * nextLine() method. Assume that the number of students is at least 2.
