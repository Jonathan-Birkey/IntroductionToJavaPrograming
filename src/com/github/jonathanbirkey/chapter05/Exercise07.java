 *     <p>(Financial application: compute future tuition) Suppose the tuition for a university is
 *     $10,000 this year and increases 5% every year. In one year, the tuition will be $10,500.
 *     Write a program that displays the tuition in 10 years, and the total cost of four yearsâ€™
 *     worth of tuition starting after the tenth year.
