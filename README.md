# IntroductionToJavaPrograming
Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures Comprehensive Version 12 by Y. Daniel Liang

This is the textbook I used to first learn programming in 2016. After having graduated and working as a software engineer for a few years now I am working through this textbook as a way to self gauge how I have progressed in my programming abilities with Java.
